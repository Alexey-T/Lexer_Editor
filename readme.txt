Stand-alone editor for CudaText/SynWrite lexers.
It is "Lexer library" dialog of SynWrite, splitted to small app.
Windows only.

Must put lexer_editor.exe to folder of CudaText, ie near cudatext.exe.
Otherwise app cannot find lexers to edit.

Source code for Delphi 7:

(to make, you need EControl engine, it is shareware.)
